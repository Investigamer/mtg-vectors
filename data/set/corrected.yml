# * Sets defined with what we consider an incorrect icon in Scryfall data. The original
#   icon defined for this set matches one of the following criteria:
#   1. Is a real icon which matches the set thematically, but the icon isn't depicted on any card in the set.
#   2. Scryfall marked icon as "default", but a more appropriate icon is available for the set.
#   3. Scryfall used a similar icon, but a better match is available.
#   4. Scryfall marked the wrong icon altogether, i.e. data entry mistake. If you encounter this problem you
#      should report it to Scryfall, they often will correct the issue.
#
# * (key) A valid Scryfall recognized set code.
# * (value) A valid symbol code found in our symbol catalog.
