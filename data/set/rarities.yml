# * List of Rarities recognized by the repository.
#
# * (key): Always "rarities".
# * (value): A list of rarity codes.
#
# * NOTES:
#   - C, U, R, M are the 4 main recognizable rarities.
#   - B (bonus) is currently only used in one set (Vintage Masters), and appears similar to Mythic.
#   - S (special) is used in a variety of promo card prints, usually (but not always) taking the appearance of
#     Mythic rarity. Generally, Scryfall will fall back to this rarity when a promo rarity isn't named or known.
#   - T (timeshifted) is treated as "S" (special) by Scryfall, however the visual treatment is different enough
#     that the custom design community considers this a separate rarity treatment.
#   - WM (watermark) is used to represent the watermark (single flat black layer) of a set symbol.
#   - H (half) is used to represent the half-cut rarity treatment used on Fraction Jackson.
#   - 80 is a dark gray treatment that appears to originate from the MTG custom design community, but I'm
#     still unsure what the purpose is/was or why it is named that.
